Since 2 quarters we are conducting our Hackathon event virtually across all markets with great collaboration and engagement. Pictorial depiction of the journey and metrics The AI Hackathon witnessed participation across Markets and Services: Highlights from FY20: There were global footprints in designing the problem statements as well as in evaluating the solutions. FY20 witnessed vendor partnerships for solutioning. We had tied up with Ellipsis, Genesys and Contact Engine. Live support was provided during the Hackathon days via MS Teams by our Subject Matter Experts and Platform leads. Few Firsts this year: Enhanced collaboration with Strategy and Consulting – Applied Intelligence. DATA+AI Hackathon was conducted for the first time in collaboration with Data teams – in FY20 Q4. Social Innovation badges were put on the people profile of all Hackathon participants. Series of socialization calls were conducted to upskill participants to prepare them for meaningful and smart solutioning, leveraging all vendor resources available. ACE + Sandbox was introduced and leveraged for solutioning for the first time for the ACE+ AI4Client Hackathon in FY20 Q3. DATA and AI Hackathon summary: AI4PublicServices The first ever DATA &amp; AI Hackathon was conducted in Q4. Below are the problem statements articulated by DATA &amp; AI teams: Problem statement 1 - How can AI and Virtual Agent support citizens to report issues on cleanliness to the local authorities. Problem Statement 2 - Categorization of issues raised, using Computer Vision and identify if it is related to road or any other issues. Problem Statement 3 - Develop an AI solution that can help understand emotion during a conversation from utterances – should include polarity and emotions. Problem Statement 4 - Develop AI solution to generate summary of COVID-19 data from public articles. The Event Days: For more information - Please visit our AI Hackathon Circle.
